## 🧠 Who I Am  
Cloud Security Engineer (in training) with a background in IT support, IAM, and hands-on infrastructure work. I specialize in **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**, **DevSecOps**, and **compliance automation**, and I’m obsessed with real-world execution, not fluff.

I’m building this portfolio with **Minimal Mistakes** to publicly showcase my journey from support to security, delivering threat-aware projects using **AWS, Azure, Terraform, OneLogin, and SSO standards** like SAML and OAuth2.

> “If it’s not automated, secure, or auditable—it’s not done.”

## 🎯 My Mission  
To break into **strategic, security-driven cloud roles** by proving my capabilities through practical, impactful work—visible, measurable, and open-source. My edge? A support engineer’s grit and a builder’s mindset.
